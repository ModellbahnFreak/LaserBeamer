# LaserBeamer
A java application to use a video projector (beamer) like a show laser.

>A (not always up to date) version of the app is available as "JavaFxBeamer.jar". It requires Java 1.8 or 9 to run.

The project was inspired by many different light shows and especially by the program ["Beamertool /Lasersim f√ºr Raspberry Pi"](https://forum.dmxcontrol-projects.org/index.php?thread/8091-beamertool-lasersim-f%C3%BCr-raspberry-pi-support-thread/&pageNo=1)


*Note: The creator of the application takes no responsibilities for anything caused by the usage of the program or the app in any other form.*
