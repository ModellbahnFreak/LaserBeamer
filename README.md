# LaserBeamer
A java application to use a video projector (beamer) like a show laser.

>A (not always up to date) version of the app is available as "[LaserBeamer.jar](https://github.com/ModellbahnFreak/LaserBeamer/raw/master/build/LaserBeamer.jar)" in the "build" Directory. It requires Java 1.8 or 9 to run. *Detailed instructions in the Wiki*

To control the "laser" the client software ([LaserClient](https://github.com/ModellbahnFreak/LaserClient)) is needed.

The project was inspired by many different light shows and especially by the program ["Beamertool /Lasersim f√ºr Raspberry Pi"](https://forum.dmxcontrol-projects.org/index.php?thread/8091-beamertool-lasersim-f%C3%BCr-raspberry-pi-support-thread/&pageNo=1)
