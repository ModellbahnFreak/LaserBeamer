# LaserBeamer
A java application to use a video projector (beamer) like a show laser.

>The compiled application can be found on the release page "[LaserBeamer.jar](https://github.com/ModellbahnFreak/LaserBeamer/releases)". It requires Java 1.8 or 9 to run. *Detailed instructions in the Wiki*

For information on how to use the LaserBeamer-Software, look at the [LaserBeamer wiki](https://github.com/ModellbahnFreak/LaserBeamer/wiki)
